\section*{3.4.7 \mdseries Let ${\cal M} = (S,\imp,L)$ be any model for CTL and
let $\llbracket\phi\rrbracket$ denote the set of all $s \in S$ such that
${\cal M}, s \models \phi$. Prove the following set identities by inspecting
the clauses of Definition 3.15 from page 211.}
% 3.4: 7 (d-f)

\subsection*{(d) \mdseries $\llbracket\phi_1 \land \phi_2\rrbracket =
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cap\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$}
% 4.	M, s |= φ1 ∧ φ2 iff. M, s |= φ1 and M, s |= φ2
We know, by clause $4$ that ${\cal M}, s \models \llbracket\phi_1 \land
\phi_2\rrbracket$ iff ${\cal M}, s \models \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket$ and
${\cal M}, s \models \llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$. That is, the set of states
$S$ of $\llbracket\phi_1 \land \phi_2\rrbracket$ must be in both of the
latter, containing no more and no less than that. Hence $\llbracket\phi_1
\land \phi_2\rrbracket$ is, by definition, the intersection of
$\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket$ and $\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$, and thereby
$\llbracket\phi_1 \land \phi_2\rrbracket =
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cap\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$.

\subsection*{(e) \mdseries $\llbracket\phi_1 \lor \phi_2\rrbracket =
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$}
% 5.	M, s | = φ1 ∨ φ2 iff. M, s |= φ1 or M, s |= φ2
By clause $5$ we have that ${\cal M}, s \models \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket$ or
${\cal M}, s \models \llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$. Since
$\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket \subseteq
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$ and
$\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket \subseteq
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$, and further that
$\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket -
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket = \llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$ and
$\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket -
\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket = \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket$, conluding that
$(\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket -
\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket) - \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket = \emptyset$, we can
rightfully conclude that $\llbracket\phi_1 \lor \phi_2\rrbracket =
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$.

\subsection*{(f) \mdseries $\llbracket\phi_1 \imp \phi_2\rrbracket =
(S - \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket)\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$}
% 6.	M, s |= φ1 → φ2 iff. M, s |≠ φ1 or M, s |= φ2
We see that by clause $6$ we have that ${\cal M}, s \not\models \phi_1$ or
${\cal M}, s \models \phi_2$. The former gives us $S -
\llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket$, as this signifies the set of states $S$ for
which $\phi_1$ does not hold. The latter gives us just that $\llbracket\phi_2
\rrbracket$. And thus, forming the union of these gives us exactly that
$\llbracket\phi_1 \imp \phi_2\rrbracket =
(S - \llbracket\phi_1\rrbracket)\cup\llbracket\phi_2\rrbracket$.

\section*{3.4.10 \mdseries Which of the following pairs of CTL formulas are
equivalent? For those which are not, exhibit a model of one of the pair which
is not a model of the other}
% 3.4: 10 (a-c)

\subsection*{(a) \mdseries $\text{EF}{\ }\phi$ and $\text{EG}{\ }\phi$}
For a model ${\cal M} = (S,\imp,L)$ consisting of the transitions $s \imp t$,
$s \imp u$ and $t \imp u$, in which only $\phi$ only holds for $t$. We see
that ${\cal M}, s \models \text{EF}{\ }\phi$ holds, as we can get from the
start node $s$ to $t$ for which $\phi$ holds. However, from $t$ we could go
to $u$ for which $\phi$ doesn't hold, hence
${\cal M}, s \not\models \text{EG}{\ }\phi$.

\subsection*{(b) \mdseries $\text{EF}{\ }\phi \lor \text{EF}{\ }\psi$ and
$\text{EF}{\ }(\phi \lor \psi)$}
Under the assumption that $\text{EF}{\ }\phi \lor \text{EF}{\ }\psi$ holds, it
then follows that there exists a future state for which either $\phi$ or
$\psi$ holds. That is, by clause $5$ definition 3.15, we have that
${\cal M}, s \models \text{EF}{\ }\phi$ or
${\cal M}, s \models \text{EF}{\ }\psi$. By expanding $\phi$ of clause $12$
for ${\cal M}, s \models \text{EF}{\ }(\phi \lor \psi)$ we get just that;
$\phi \lor \psi$ must hold at some point in the future, which is satisfied.

\subsection*{(c) \mdseries $\text{AF}{\ }\phi \lor \text{AF}{\ }\psi$ and
$\text{AF}{\ }(\phi \lor \psi)$}
Consider a model ${\cal M}, s \models (S,\imp,L)$ which includes three states
$s$, $t$ and $u$, for which $s$ none of $\phi$ or $\psi$ hold, that is $L(s)
= \emptyset$. For $t$ and $u$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ holds respectively, that is
$L(t) = \phi$ and $L(u) = \psi$. Given the transitions $s \imp t$ and $s \imp
u$ we can confirm that ${\cal M}, s \models AF{\ }\phi \lor AF{\ }\psi$, as
well as ${\cal M}, s \models AF{\ }(\phi \lor \psi)$. However, if we add the
transitions $t \imp t$ and $u \imp u$, we see that we can go to either of
these, and stay there forever showing that
${\cal M}, s \not\models AF{\ }\phi \lor AF{\ }\psi$.

\subsection*{Specifications}
I have specified safety by the condition that $\text{AG} \neg( (p_0.state = c)
\land (p_1.state = c) )$, meaning that no where in the execution of the program
will a process enter its critical section if the other is.

As for liveness I have that $\text{AG} ( (p_i.state = t) \imp \text{AF}
(p_i.state = c) )$, meaning that for any process in its trying state will
eventually reach its critical state.

\newpage
\subsection*{Safety trace}
\lstinputlisting{safety-trace.out}
As lines $42$ and $52$ of the trace shows, this did in fact occur; both
processes entered their critical states.

\newpage
\subsection*{Liveness trace}
\lstinputlisting{liveness-trace.out}
Examining the trace output, we see that on line $40$ the process $p_0$ enters
its trying state $t$, but did not reach its critical state as a consequence of
the looped state path as of line $36$.
